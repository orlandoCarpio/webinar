Sell Pages/Posts through WooCommerce 2.6+ quickly and easily. Tested up to WooCommerce Version 4.0.x

== Description ==
Quickly and easily sell access to pages, posts and custom post types through WooCommerce with Pay For Post with WooCommerce.  I originally created this plugin because I looked everywhere and I couldn't find a plugin already out there, free or premium, that would do the simple fact of selling access to a particular page or post through WooCommerce.  So I decided to write my own.

= Requirements =
* WooCommerce version 2.6+ to be installed and active
* Guest checkout to be turned OFF
* PHP 5.6+  PHP 7.3+ is recommended but 5.6 will work.

= How It Works =
Getting everything setup will take you less than 5 minutes with three simple steps.

- **Step 1** Create a product in WooCommerce
- **Step 2** Create a page or post in Wordpress
- **Step 3** Associate your product with your page using the Pay For Post with WooCommerce meta box.

**It's that simple.**

>With the Premium version, you have several other options for protecting content like, time based, number of page views, etc.


== Demo ==
You can view a front-end demo by going to [https://demo.pramadillo.com](https://demo.pramadillo.com) if you would like to schedule an admin demo please visit [https://pramadillo.com/support](https://pramadillo.com/support) and select Plugin Admin Demo.


== Features ==
* Restrict content from pages, posts and custom post types based on if they have purchased a specific WooCommerce product
* Ability to protect a single post or multiple posts with a single product
* Ability to protect posts with multiple products
* Simple to use
* Uses native WooCommerce functionality to ensure future compatibility
* Global restricted content message which is used for **all** protected content
* Utilize any standard WooCommerce shortcodes
* **PREMIUM ONLY** Ability to override Restricted Content Message on a per page basis
* **PREMIUM ONLY** Delay Restriction - This allows you to delay the paywall from appearing for a set amount of time.
* **PREMIUM ONLY** Page View Restriction - This allows you to limit the number of page views the user who purchased this product has before the paywall reappears. Options to specify over a set amount of time or forever.
* **PREMIUM ONLY** Expiry Restriction - This allows you to specify an expiration on this post which would require the user to repurchase the product associated with this post.
* **PREMIUM ONLY** Custom WooCommerce tab on the My Account page to list out all purchased content
* **PREMIUM ONLY** Listing of purchased content on order receipt and order confirmation page
* **PREMIUM ONLY** PolyLang Multiple Language support
* **PREMIUM ONLY** Priority Support
* **PREMIUM ONLY** Woo Memberships Support!
* **PREMIUM ONLY** Woo Subscriptions Support!

>The premium version of this plugin consists of more advanced features to really get the most out of selling your pages and posts! To purchase the premium version please visit [https://pramadillo.com/plugins/woocommerce-pay-per-post/](https://pramadillo.com/plugins/woocommerce-pay-per-post/)

= Shortcodes =

`[woocommerce-payperpost template='purchased']`
This outputs an unordered list of the posts that have been purchased by the current user logged in.

>There are several additional shortcodes available in the free and premium version.  Take a look at [https://pramadillo.com/plugins/woocommerce-pay-per-post/](https://pramadillo.com/plugins/woocommerce-pay-per-post/) for other available shortcodes.

= Template Functions =
**IMPORTANT** Out of the box this plugin will work with any theme which uses the standard Wordpress function `the_content()`. For those themes that do not utilize `the_content()` you can use the following static functions in your templates.

`Woocommerce_Pay_Per_Post_Helper::has_access()`
This checks if the current user has access to the page.  It returns true/false

`Woocommerce_Pay_Per_Post_Helper::get_no_access_content()`
This returns the content specified in the PPP Options.

>For a full example of this take a look at [https://pramadillo.com/plugins/woocommerce-pay-per-post/](https://pramadillo.com/plugins/woocommerce-pay-per-post/)

== Installation ==
1. Activate the plugin through the `Plugins` menu in WordPress
1. Browse to Admin->WooCommerce PayPerPost->Settings
1. Go to Page or Post and you should see a meta box for Pay For Post with WooCommerce.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do you offer installation and customization services? =
Yes, if you need help with installation and/or would like additional customization work done for your website, you can fill out a request form at [https://pramadillo.com/support](https://pramadillo.com/support)

= I wish this plugin had XZY feature =

While I try to do my best to incorporate new features all the time, I implemented a new Feature Request board located at [https://pramadillo.com/feature-requests](https://pramadillo.com/feature-requests)

= Can this plugin work with custom post types? =

Yes, this plugin worked with all custom post types.  In the settings you can add and remove which post types you would like the metabox to show up on.

= How do you link to your post after an order has been placed? =

What I have done in the past is use the Order Notes for the product in WooCommerce. So what will happen is after they purchase, on the Payment Received page they will see the order notes, and they will get sent in the receipt also.

So for instance, I have a Vimeo video that I embed in a page, on the Vimeo Product in WooCommerce I add the Password and notes on how to view the video, they gets transmitted via email and on the thank you page for the user.

**For PREMIUM users, there is a built in option to include the post links in the order email, confirmation screen and on the users My Account page.**

= Do I need to have user accounts turned on? =

Yes, in order to keep track of who purchased what, it is a requirement that all customers have user accounts/

= Do you offer support? =

Yes, I do the absolute best I can to support the free version of the plugin.  If you upgrade to the premium version you will have priority support.
